First public release.
The toolkit, although still a bit rough in the edges, is able to handle the relevant
radiotherapy DICOM modalities, and features a number of useful classes and convenience
methods designed to make it easy to extract and manipulate radiotherapy information.
The toolkit features a mostly complete test suite, along with a small selection
of sample DICOM files.
